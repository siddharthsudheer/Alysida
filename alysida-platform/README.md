## Introduction
The goal of this project is to design and develop an easy-to-use blockchain framework for people that want a jumpstart on developing applications using this technology.  This project is intended to provide the underlying blockchain foundation, which is built abstractly, to allow developers to comfortably construct applications that can interact with the network and the blockchain through APIs –– not needing to worry about network protocols, database protocols, and blockchain protocols. Additionally, this project focuses on using a relational database to store the blockchain, rather conforming to the noSQL standard being used by most of the other blockchains. The rationale for this decision lies in the simple fact that relational databases have been effectively used for more than a few decades now, and has been a trusted system for most companies and developers dealing with data. Several aspects of the system such as the design, architecture, tools, background and future ideas will be discussed in the paper, which will complement the software.
